CHAPTER 10 CASE STUDY 1: UNIX, LINUX AND ANDROID
    Other Variations of UNIX
        AIX
        FreeBSD
        HP-UX
        SCO UNIX
        System V
        Solaris
    Was pet project of Ken Thompson
    UNICS - (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service)
10.2 LINUX OVERVIEW
    -Principle of least surprise: Let everything be simple, elegant and consistent
    -Every program should do just one thing and do it well
    -Avoid useless redundancy
    10.2.2 Interfaces to Linux
        User Interface --> Library Interface --> System Call Interface
        Users--> Standard Utility Programs(shell, editors) --> Standard Library (open, close, read, write, fork) --> Linux OS (process management, memory management, I/O) --> Hardware (CPU, memory)
        |---------------------User MODE-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------Kernel Mode-------------------|

       - SYSTEM CALLS
            - READ, WRITE, OPEN, CLOSE, FORK etc
            - Programs make system cals by putting arguments in registers or on the stack and issuing trap instructions to switch from user to kernel mode
            - There is no way to write a TRAP instruction in C but a library is provided with one procedure per system call
            - Procedure are written in assembly but can be called from C
                - each first puts its arguments in the proper place then executes the trap instruction
            - The library interface NOT the system call interface is specified by POSIX 
            - POSIX = operating system standards 1003.2
        - Library Calls
            - command processor (shell), compilers, editors, text-processors and file manipulation utilities
        - User interface
            - Similar to the first GUIs with an added Mouse oriented keyboard interface rather than keyboard oriented
            - Popular Desktop Enviroments for Linux
                - GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Enviroment)
                - KDE (K Desktop Enviroment)
            - GUIs supported by X Windowing System or X11 or X
                - Defines communication and display protocols for manipulating windows on bitmap displays
                - X Server controls devices like keyboard, mouse and screen
                - X redirects input to or accepts output from client program
                - Can be started via command line, but is typically started during the boot process by a display manager
                - xterm = terminal emulator
