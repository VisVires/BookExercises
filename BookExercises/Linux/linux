NETWORKING NOMAD LINUX PART 3


NETWORK SHARING
File Sharing Overview
    --When working within a network, the way to transfer data is network file sharing
    --file sharing tool
        --scp command
            -secure copy, works like cp but allows you to transfer between hosts on the same network. Works via ssh
            --examples:
            -copy a file from local host to remote host:
            scp myfile.txt username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
            -copy a file from a remote host to your local host
            scp username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory/myfile.txt /local/directory
            -copy directory from local host to remote host
            scp -r mydir username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
rsync
    --Another tool to copy data from different hosts
    --short for remote synchronization
    --different from scp in that it uses a special algorithm to see data you're copying to and will only copy differences
    --verifies file with checksums
    --ideal for directory synch remotely and locally, data backups and large data transfers
    FLAGS
        -- v -verbose
        -- r -recursive
        -- h -human readable output
        -- z - compressed for easier transfer, great for slow connections
    -copy/sync files on same host
    rsync -zvr /my/local/directory/one /my/local/directory/two
    -copy/sync files to local host from a remote host
    rsync /local/directory username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory
    -copy/sync files to a remote host from a local host
    rsync username@remotehost.com:/remote/directory /local/directory
Simple HTTP Server
    --Python quick network share that other machines on the network can access
    -- sets up a basic webserver that you can access via the localhost address
    -- grab the IP address of the machine you ran it on and then on another machine access it it in the browser with: http:://IP_ADDRESS:8000.
    --You can view files by typing http://localhost:8000 in the web browser
    --You can also do this with node
NFS
    Standard network file share for linux
    NFS
        -allows a server to share directories and files with one or more clients over a network
        -setting up NFS client
            sudo service nfsclient start
            sudo mount server:/directory/mount_directory
        -Automounting
            -setup automounting to keep the server permanently mounted
            -automount tool or amd
            - when a file is accessed in the specified directory automount will look up the remote server and automatically mount it
Samba
    -SMB
        -Secure Message Block Protocol originally for Windows to Linux but was optimized to form the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol
    -Samba
        --The linux utilities to work with CIFS on Linux
        --To Install:
            --Install
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install samba
            --Setup smb.conf
            sudo vim /etc/samba.smb.conf
            --Setup password
            sudo smbpasswd -a [username]
            --Create a shared directory
            mkdir /my/directory/to/share
            --Restart the Samba Service
            sudo service smbd restart
            --Access via windows
            smbclient //HOST/directory -U user
            --instead of transferring one by one you can just mount the network share on your system
            sudo mount -t cifs servername:directory mountpount -o user=username,pass=password
