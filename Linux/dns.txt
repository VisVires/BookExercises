Name Server

Zone File-

    How to get it
Resource Records
    A zone file is made up of these and each line is a record and contains info about the hosts
    - Includes:
        Record Name
        TTL: time after which we discard the record and obtain a new one
        Class: Namespace of the record information 
            Most commonly IN for internet
        Type: Type of info stored in record data
            A Record
            MX Record
            PTR Record
            CNAME
            NS Record
            HINFO Record
            ISDN Record
            SOA Record
        Data: IP if its an A record or something else if it was something else

DNS Process:
    1. Host asks local DNS where is domain "domainname.com"
    2. Local DNS server asks the Root Servers by talking to a recursive DNS server provided by the ISP
    3. One of 13 root servers (or a mirrored version of it) asks the .com Top-Level Domain DNS server at an IP address it gives us
    4. We send new request to Top-Level Domain name server. If the TLD server doesn't have "domain.com" in its zone file it will find the Name server that does and send us the IP of that name server
    5. Send final request to Authoritative DNS server with the record we want which has the zone file and a resource record for www of this host so it sends us the IP address

DNS Setup -- where to find info on how to set up a DNS server
    BIND: Most popular DNS Server on the Internet
    DNSmasq: Lightweight and easier to configure than BIND, recommended for smaller network
    PowerDNS: Full Featured like BIND with more flexibility. Reads info from mulitple databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL etc. 

DNS tools:
    nslookup [hostname] : query nae servers to find info about resource records
    dig: tool to get info about DNS name servers, more flexible than NS lookup
